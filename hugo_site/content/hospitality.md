# Hospitality

It's a good idea to book your accommodation early on. One option is to buy a ticket and use the attendee channels ([Slack invitation link](https://join.slack.com/t/djangoconeurope2019/shared_invite/enQtNTExODc1NDk5NDk0LWQ1MmM1YzBjZTNhZWZjODc3YTRlNGJjNTljYTMyZDgzM2E3NGU3YjY0ZjBiM2E4YmQxMDQ4NTU1NjQxMTdjMzE)) to organize accommodation with others. You may also prefer a classic hotel or hostel.
